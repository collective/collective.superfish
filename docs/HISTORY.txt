0.3 - Unreleased
----------------

- Replace " with &quot; to keep valid HTML if description contains quotes.
  [saily]

- Made id-generation more resistent against duplicated id's. We now use
  normalized urls to generate the item id.  [saily]

- added support to include portal_tabs in the superfish navigation by setting
  ``ADD_PORTAL_TABS = True`` in subclasses [fRiSi]

- added some documentation targeted at integrators [fRiSi]

- don't render superfish_init.js with ``inline=True`` since this leads to
  strange errors in
  Products.ResourceRegistries-2.0b2-py2.6.egg/Products/ResourceRegistries/browser/scripts.pt
  eg when adding a `StaticText Portlet`

  ``AttributeError: 'DirContainedFileResource5' object has no attribute 'POST'``

  according to the `resourceregistry documentation`_ it's better to set inline to `False`
  in any case.
